# Simplifit

Simplifit is a simple workout tracker for Android that allows users to enter and track their fitness data.

Since this is my first android project, I don't plan on publishing it to the Play store but rather am creating it for my own educational purposes.

I am open to any and all suggestions for improving the app.
In the future I am looking to add graphs to track fitness progress over a longer period of time, as well as remove any remaining bugs in the current version.
